This blog is a place where I have the freedom to be myself and to express in writing everything I feel strongly about. </p> <p> Like most writers, Iâ€™m also a reader. I prefer fantasy, speculative fiction and science fiction. I am also a fan of mythology, Chicken Soup for the Soul and books on completely random topics that arenâ€™t focused on technical terms. </p> <p> Language is one of my favourite things to study. I love the way some languages resemble each other in bits and pieces. My neurons fire when I think about morphology or syntax or semantics or phonetics. Logic figures very prominently in linguistics, did you guys know? </p> </div> <div class="column is-4"> <p> You might wonder if Iâ€™m, perhaps, a Lit or Language Studies major in university. Wellâ€¦no. Iâ€™m a college sophomore with a day-life as a Computer Science student. I spend my days working out problem sets in Discrete Math, playing Fortnite, puzzling over Data Structures and Algorithms and wondering how I ever came to be here. </p> <p> Iâ€™m also a huge foodie, although my stomach can handle only a small portion of food. I love exploring the savoury side of things, and I would like to mention that I love the fried wontons and the sticky rice I had on a recent trip to Kuala Lumpur with my family. </p> </div> <div class="column is-4"> <p> Sometime in the future, I would love to travel more in a world that is safe and not threatened by guns and terror attacks and abuse and discrimination. I would love to work somewhere that will allow me to use my coding skills and my language side in perfect unison. I would love to publish a book that connects to people and/ or makes them think differently than what theyâ€™re used to. </p> <p> Ants are crawling on my desk as I write this. </p> <p> Stay happy. Stay inspired. Learn something new every day. </p> <p> Sincerely, <br> The Nerdy Snickerdoodle </p> </div> </article> </div> </main> </section> <footer class=footer> <div class="content has-text-centered"> <p> <strong class=is-primary>Violet</strong> by <a href=https://siddharthsham.github.io>Siddharth Sham</a> ðŸ’œ </p> </div> </footer></div> <script>__SAPPER__={baseUrl:"/flora",preloaded:[void 0,{}]};if('serviceWorker' in navigator)navigator.serviceWorker.register('/flora/service-worker.js');</script><script src=/flora/client/6bab394a94b25521308f/main.js></script> <script src=//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-editor@latest/dist/js/medium-editor.min.js></script> <script src=https://unpkg.com/micromodal/dist/micromodal.min.js></script>
